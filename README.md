# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning and Text Generation Documentation

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset and generating text responses using the fine-tuned model.

## 1. Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You will need the following libraries:
- `datasets`
- `evaluate`
- `transformers[sentencepiece]`
- `accelerate`
- `torch`

## 2. Loading Datasets for Fine-Tuning

Load your dataset from a CSV file. Ensure that your dataset contains columns for `question` and `answer`.

## 3. Loading Pretrained GPT-2 Model for Fine-Tuning

Load the pretrained GPT-2 model and tokenizer. The tokenizer will handle converting text into tokens that the model can process.

## 4. Preparing the Datasets

Define a data collator to handle the batching of the data and a preprocessing function to tokenize the text data. This step involves adding special tokens and mapping the dataset to the required format.

## 5. Splitting the Dataset for Training and Evaluation

Split the dataset into training and evaluation sets. This allows you to train the model on one portion of the data and validate its performance on another.

## 6. Checking Vocabulary for Model and Tokenizer

Check the vocabulary size of both the tokenizer and the model. This ensures that the tokenizer and the model are compatible and that the token IDs are correctly mapped.

## 7. Check if CUDA is Available

Verify if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available for training. Utilizing a GPU can significantly speed up the training process.

## 8. Training or Fine-Tuning the Pretrained GPT-2 Model

Set up training arguments and initialize the trainer. This includes specifying the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and other training parameters. Train the model using the prepared dataset.

## 9. Generating Text

Define a function to generate text using the fine-tuned model. This function will take an input sequence, tokenize it, and use the model to generate a continuation of the sequence.

## 10. Deploying to Hugging Face for Checkpoints

Login to your Hugging Face account and push the trained model to the Hugging Face Hub. This allows you to share your model and access it from anywhere.

## 11. Calling the Model from Hugging Face Checkpoint

Load the fine-tuned model from the Hugging Face Hub. This involves downloading the model and tokenizer from the specified checkpoint and using them to generate text.

## 12. Generating Text from the Deployed Model

Use the loaded model to generate text based on input sequences. This step involves tokenizing the input, generating the text, and decoding the output tokens back into readable text.

## Summary

This guide covers the entire process of fine-tuning a GPT-2 model on a custom dataset and generating text with it. By following these steps, you can customize a powerful language model to suit specific tasks and deploy it for use in various applications.
